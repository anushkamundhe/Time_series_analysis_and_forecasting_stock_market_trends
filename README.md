## ðŸ“Š Workflow Overview

1. **Data Collection**
   - Historical stock data was downloaded using Yahoo Finance or CSV files.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted date columns to datetime format
   - Cleaned missing values
   - Visualized and tested for stationarity (using rolling mean and ADF test)

3. **Model Building (ARIMA)**
   - Identified the best (p, d, q) values using ACF and PACF plots
   - Trained ARIMA model on the historical data
   - Forecasted stock prices for the next 15/30 days

4. **Exporting Results**
   - Forecast results were saved into an Excel file for integration with Power BI

5. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - An interactive dashboard was built showing:
     - Actual vs Forecasted prices
     - Trendlines
     - Date-wise predictions
     - Summary statistics
